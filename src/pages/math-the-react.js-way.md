Have you found yourself doing intense math problems using weird symbols like `+`,
`âˆ’`, `Ã·`, and `Ã—`? Do you enjoy the speed and developer experience of React.js? Thanks
to `react-real-math` you can now harness the power of the React.js Virtual DOM to
make your Math blazing ðŸ”¥ fast!

`react-real-math` provides an incredibly easy to understand API out of the gate,
for free. What a deal! Letâ€™s take a look at an example of `react-real-math` in
action. Consider this old-school almost obfuscated math problem:

>1+1Ã—2=?

Incredibly hard to parse. But with `react-real-math` this is a breeze to
understand:

```js
import { computeValue, Multiply, One, Two } from 'react-real-math'

console.log(computeValue(
  <Multiply by={<Two/>}>
    <One/>
  </Multiply>
))
```

Now thatâ€™s what I call ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ family. Blazing fast, amazing DX, and great DSL.
Not only is this incredibly easy to read, new developers can easily understand
whatâ€™s going on here. If you would like to contribute to `react-real-math` please
